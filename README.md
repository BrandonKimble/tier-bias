# Tier Bias - Rank Anything and Everything (In Progress)

Tier Bias is social web app that lets you share ranked lists or "tiers" about anything you want. On Tier Bias, users are encouraged to express their preferences and really _own_ their biases. There are no pictures, videos, or GIFs allowed on the site unless included as part of a ranked list, creating an environment where value is to be found in the quality of users' tiers and their reasoning behind them. 

Here's the kicker, friends and other users are free to re-rank any tiers themselves -- users are given the ability to vote on any item of a posted tier, effectively creating a "second ranking" or a way to observe the public thinks surrounding your tier. Finally, the comment section serves as a 'battle ground' for friends and/or strangers to debate about the proper ranking of a tier.

## User Story Examples

Creator:
User creates tier -> friends see tier and disagree/agree with a few of the rankings made -> friends down/up vote the top element of the user's tier -> the top element gains lots of down/up votes -> other users turn to the comment section to voice their opinion about the tier.

Lurker:
User searches for best soup in the local area -> user receives lots of links to relevant list created by creator on the platform -> user navigates to the tier with the most interaction and finds the ranking of local soup dishes very helpful -> user to decided to try the soup ranked second because it collects more upvotes from the public than the top-ranked soup -> user likes or saves the tier, thanks the poster for the great recommendations, and enjoys some good soup.
